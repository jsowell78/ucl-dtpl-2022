Make a list of things needed from Irina

  - questions from Irina (week-01)
  - links to department and select staff
  - links to existing and completed projects
  - links to select important reports
  - connected curriculum

Based on your experiences in the past, what is your vision for the lectureship, specifically for education, research, and policy?

Make sure to say education, teaching is you focused, and there is a lot that goes into the education portfolio


  - group projects, supervision
  - skills development
  - research-based education is broader than teaching in the conventional sense
  - idea of connected curriculum


Make sure you give them a summary at the start
Not an overview or roadmap, but a summary, then go into the depth.  Critical slide in setting the scene and making it easy to follow me

The question is what you will do in this role, less on what you *have* done
When thinking of what I bring in, focus on what you are bringing in and where I will be taking it

For the content summary overview slide, show that I know what STEaPP's mission and vision is, and how I will position myself and the vision

Spend some time getting the schedule done
